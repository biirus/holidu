Dear Holidu team,

Here I created a basic React + Redux application about vacation rentals search.
It's defenetely not ideal, I'd like to spend more time on design responsivness, caching results and search params, add some autocomplete features to the search form.
Unfortunately I had not enough time to finish all features that I wanted.

According the immutable data structures: I used the `redux-toolkit` which uses `immer` under the hood, that's why I don't really have to worry about data mutability.

Another important thing is project structure. I prefer the `dux` paradigm and
`createSlice` is really helpfull to reduce boilerplate.

Anyway, it was really fun to work on this task. I hope you will find it interesting to check my code =)
